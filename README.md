Plant classfication

This project is inspired by a plant leaf identification system created by Aayush Gupta (Link). Aayush Gupta used a machine learning model called Support Vector Machines(SVM) for building the system and the accuracy rate was 90.5%.

We will be using the same database but different model, a convolutional neural network model - VGG16 to improve the accuracy rate.
